Git commands I learned so far ...
1.git status
  It checks and shows the current status of working tree with staged area and gives a list of files to be staged and committed.
2.git add
  It adds files to the staging area.
3.git commit
  This command saves the files in version tracking system.
4.git clone
  This command is used to obtain a repository from an existing URL.
5.git push
  This sends the committed changes to the remote repository at server.
